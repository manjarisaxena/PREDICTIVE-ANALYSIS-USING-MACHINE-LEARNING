# Predictive Analysis Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predictive analytics using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze the `diamonds.csv` dataset and build a model that can accurately predict outcomes based on the given features.

## 📂 Dataset
- **File**: `diamonds.csv`
- **Description**: This dataset contains attributes of diamonds, such as carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, price, and more.
- **Objective**: Predict the price of a diamond based on its attributes.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
To run this project on Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. **Upload the dataset to Colab**:
   - Navigate to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
   - Upload `diamonds.csv` to your session storage

2. **Load the dataset in Colab**:
   ```python
   from google.colab import files
   import pandas as pd

   uploaded = files.upload()
   df = pd.read_csv('diamonds.csv')
   df.head()
   ```

3. **Install necessary libraries**:
   ```python
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open `PREDICTIVE_ANALYSIS_USING_MACHINE_LEARNING.ipynb` in Google Colab
   - Execute the cells step by step

## 🛠 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Distribution of features
   - Correlation analysis
   - Outlier detection
   
3. **Model Building**:
   - Regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
   - Hyperparameter tuning
   - Performance evaluation

## 📊 Results & Insights
- **Model Performance**: RMSE, MAE, R² Score
- **Feature Importance**: Key attributes affecting diamond prices
- **Observations**: Insights derived from data analysis

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning models
- Deploy the model as a web application
- Add more feature engineering techniques
